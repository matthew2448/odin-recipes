        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Naan (pronounced nahn) is an oven-baked, leavened bread that is stuffed and flavored in a variety of ways. An
            essential
            part of South and Central Asian cuisine, naan is easy, affordable, and makes the most of pantry ingredients you
            already
            have on hand.
        
            Flour, yeast, milk, and butter make a tender dough that's simply seasoned with garlic and salt, but there is a wide
            array of naan bread flavors. You'll find everything from coconut and raisin-stuffed bread to saucy lamb-topped naan
            in
            restaurants and home kitchens around the world.

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough.</li>
            <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of
            a golf ball; you should have about 14. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to
            rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat.</li>
            <li>Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle.</li>
            <li>Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place a few pieces of dough in the pan (as many as you can fit) and
            cook until puffy and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush butter onto the uncooked sides, flip, and cook until
            browned, 2 to 4 more minutes. Remove from the grill and repeat to cook the remaining naan.</li>
